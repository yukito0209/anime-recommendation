# Anime Recommendation Based on Anime Dataset 2023

This is one of my mini projects during the course **Analytical Programming with Python**.  

The dataset used in this project is here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset.  

In this project, we analyzed and answered **5 questions**:

 (1) What is the overall distribution of anime ratings on
 MyAnimeList, and what key features does it exhibit? 
 (RQ1)  
 (2) How do fundamental features of anime, such as genre,
 premiere year, and number of episodes, correlate with
 ratings? (RQ2)  
 (3) How are user ratings distributed on the platform, and
 are there observable biases or tendencies in user rating
 behaviors? (RQ3)  
 (4) How do user characteristics and behaviors, including
 age, gender andothers,influenceratingbehavior? (RQ4)  
 (5) Howcanweeffectively recommendhigh-quality, highly
rated animations to users by integrating both anime
 and user features? (RQ5)
